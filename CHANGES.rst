:notes:
    Be careful with image aspect ratios ! 100% width means that portrait

:notes:

    After upgrading to this release, make sure your difficulty levels
    are ordered by *id* column in Geotrek DB, or use the last version (0.20) to
    be able to edit *ids* in Geotrek Adminsite.

* Fix trek detail language redirections (fixes #9)
* Upgraded to Leaflet 0.6.4
* Upgraded to django-leaflet 0.7

:notes:

    In order to upgrade, run ``make clean`` before ``make deploy``.

    Attributions settings have changed. Attribution string is now the third
    item in layer definition (ex: ('detail', 'http://...', '(c) OSM')).
    
    Add a line with ``NO_GLOBALS: False,`` in ``LEAFLET_CONFIG``.
    
    Compare yours with example bloc in ``settings_local.py.sample``.
