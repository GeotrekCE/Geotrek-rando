*For now, NodeJS version used is v6, and we are working to update it*

In order to avoid editing NGINX configuration at each upgrade, you can rename the folders.

```commandline
mv /path/to/application/ /path/to/application.old/
mv /path/to/Geotrek-rando-X.Y.Z/ /path/to/application/

Make sure the NGINX virtualhost refers to the folder of this new version.

npm install
```

Copy the custom folder of the previous version.

```commandline
