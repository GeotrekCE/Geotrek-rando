## Overview

![Geotrek](/public/images/logo-geotrek.png)

Geotrek-rando is [FLOSS][] dedicated to display geographic and touristic contents.

These contents may be provided by linking this app either to the API of a [Geotrek-admin][] instance or directly to static datas generated by a [Geotrek-admin][] instance _(Cf. [data source][])_.

Geotrek-rando is build as a [Single Page Application][SPA] using [AngularJS][] as main application framework, [Leaflet][] for displaying the maps, and many other smaller libraries and utilities.
Everything is bound as a single javascript bundle using [Browserify][], managed through [Gulp][] tasks.

### History

The first version (v1) was builded on top of Django framework, like Geotrek-admin. But maintaining such a backend application was a kind of lose of time with no added value. Since the second version, Geotrek-rando is now a [Rich Internet application][RIA] which has a very small hosting footprint.

## Prerequisites

As Geotrek-rando works as a [SPA][], you only need an http server like [Nginx][] or [Apache][]. _(Cf. [http server][])_

You'll also need to build the javascript main bundle which require [nodejs and npm][node]\* to be available on the building environment. (Cf. [Installing NodeJS][])

Building environment could be either the same as your http server, or a local machine from which you'll sync generated files to the main server instance

_\* In recent versions of Geotrek-rando, you'll find the recommended version of Node JS into the `.nvmrc` file in the root directory of the project._

### For developpers

Some npm packages used for tests may need a build environment for compiling platform specific binaries. On debian-like environments, `build-essential` should satisfy this requirements.

_See [contribute][] section for more details about participating to Geotrek-rando development._

## Install

Download and extract latest release of Geotrek-Rando from [GitHub](https://github.com/GeotrekCE/Geotrek-rando/releases/latest).

_You may also download sources by cloning git repository._

### Install build dependencies

```
cd Geotrek-rando-*
npm install
```

### Launch build task

```
npm run dist
```

It will :
* Create missing config files
* Create the main JavaScript bundle as `dist/public/scripts/rando.js`
* Compile sass files and bundle them in `dist/public/styles/rando.css` and `dist/public/styles/rando-vendors.css`

For automaticly building bundles when editing files, use :

```
npm run watch
```

## Software update

Download and extract the latest release of Geotrek-Rando from GitHub (https://github.com/GeotrekCE/Geotrek-rando/releases).

Before upgrading, READ CAREFULLY the release notes, either from the CHANGES files or online.

```
wget https://github.com/makinacorpus/Geotrek-rando/archive/X.Y.Z.zip
unzip X.Y.Z.zip
```

In order to avoid editing NGINX configuration at each upgrade, you can rename the folders.

```
mv /path/to/application/ /path/to/application.old/
mv /path/to/Geotrek-rando-X.Y.Z/ /path/to/application/
```

Make sure the NGINX virtualhost refers to the folder of this new version. 

Install the new version of the application.

```
cd /path/to/application/
npm install
```

Copy the custom folder of the previous version.

```
cp -aR ../previous-version/custom/ .
```

Launch build task

```
npm run dist
```

## Settings & customization

Most of the settings (mainly everything about contents) has to be done directly in [Geotrek-admin][], but some parameters regarding Geotrek-rando have to be set up in a specific file. _(Cf. [Settings][])_

There is also a way to adjust the look and feel of the user interface by creating some specific files which will be used in place of defaults. For exemple: you could have your own header or footer files allowing you to include new elements without having to make change\* to Geotrek-rando core files. _(Cf. [Customization][])_

**NB:** Each time you add, delete or modify a setting or a customization file, you have to rebuild the main javascript bundle.

_\* Making changes to core files of Geotrek-rando could prevent the possibility of upgrading it without losing your changes._

## About FLOSS

If you're wondering what means _Libre_ in [FLOSS][], it essentially imply four freedoms :
* The freedom to **run** the program for any purpose.
* The freedom to **study** how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* The freedom to **redistribute** copies so you can help your neighbor.
* The freedom to **improve** the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.
